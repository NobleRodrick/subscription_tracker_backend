## This is how the project is going through
### 1 - npx express-generator --no-view --git ./
### 2 - we deleted the bin, public and routes folders
### cleanedup the contents within the app, as we are doing everything from scratch

### We install nodemon as a dev dependency as follows: npm install --save-dev nodemon(will always restart our server when we make changes)
### We make this runnign with npm run dev command in order to activate the nodemon(learning is really coolðŸ˜Š)

### We will also install eslint to ensure that our code is always clean and well formatted. this is done with the command: npx eslint --init

### The next step is to install: npm install dontenv which will helop us to retrieve our environment variable

### other installed dependencies are the following
#### - npm install jsonwebtoken, bcrypt

### Revised on the concept of controllers
